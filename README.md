# rddm package 

Package to fit diffusion models to 2AFC task data. Includes modules to fit:
- pure ddm and extended ddm with fixed bounds, using the rtdist package
- pure and extended ddm with collapsing bounds, using integral equation method from [Smith 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10973778), also see [Voskuilen et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5450920/)
- pulsed evidence model, similar to [Brunton et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23559254)

currently under development, will post examples soon...
